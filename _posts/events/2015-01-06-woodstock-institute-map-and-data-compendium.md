[Katie Buitrago](https://twitter.com/katiebuitrago) and Julianna Nunez from [Woodstock Institute](http://www.woodstockinst.org/) will demo two recently launched tools to help understand economic trends throughout the state of Illinois:

* [Interactive map](http://www.woodstockinst.org/content/woodstock-institute-interactive-map) - a [MapBox/TileMill](https://www.mapbox.com/tilemill/)-powered site that shows geographic patterns of employment, foreclosures, and more.
* [Data compendium](http://compendium.woodstockinst.org/) - a [CKAN](http://ckan.org/) site with dozens of datasets assembled by the former Metro Chicago Information Center (MCIC) and Woodstock Institute. 

Some of their data include: 

* Poverty levels
* Average loan values for mortgages
* Changes in long-term vacancies
* Employment rates
* The amount of foreclosure filings
