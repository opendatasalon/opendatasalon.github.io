**UPDATE:** Our presenter had to cancel due to illness. We'll be having an Open Hack Session instead. We'll reschedule Noel for a later date!

[Noel Peterson](https://github.com/nmpeterson) from the [Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning](http://www.cmap.illinois.gov/) (CMAP) will give an overview of their travel modeling activities – how they model the Chicago region’s travel behavior and why – focusing on the data inputs used to inform the models and the outputs they get from them. 

Noel will also talk about the differences between CMAP's traditional 'trip-based' model, as well as the 'activity-based' model that they are currently developing. He’ll also highlight the datasets that CMAP makes publicly available.
