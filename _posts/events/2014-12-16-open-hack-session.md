For our last Open Gov Hack Night of 2014, there will be no presentation. Just come to build, share, and learn about civic tech!

#### We're moving to Braintree!

Starting on January 13, 2015 the Open Gov Hack Night will be hosted at the [Braintree](https://www.braintreepayments.com/) office on the **8th floor of the Merchandise mart**. Our event has [long outgrown](https://www.flickr.com/photos/91210421@N03/14635938643/) our space at [1871](http://1871.com/), and we're excited to use Braintree's [atrium](http://static.squarespace.com/static/502bb636e4b04c0138eceed6/t/54383396e4b0673fa5b93ce8/1412969374382/) and [meeting rooms](https://scontent-a-ord.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xfa1/v/t1.0-9/10624866_844167315627614_4575618497586207414_n.jpg?oh=b4e5d218a9996f41edd2ae2cf1c04f62&oe=5507C84D) for even more civic hacking!

A huge thanks to 1871 for hosting us for two and a half years!
