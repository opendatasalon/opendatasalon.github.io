[Dan Platt](https://twitter.com/daniel_platt) and [Craig Booth](https://github.com/narrativecraig) from [Narrative Science](http://www.narrativescience.com/) will talk about using Chicago's open [crime report data](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present/ijzp-q8t2) to automatically generate narratives using their [Quill Platform](http://www.narrativescience.com/quill). 

They'll touch on the data analytics used to produce stories and how the same method could be applied to other types of civic data to find interesting insights.
