Open Gov Hack Night - International Edition!

[Right to Information](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_Information_Act) (RTI) is legislation in India similar to the [Freedom of Information Act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_Information_Act_%28United_States%29) (FOIA) in the U.S.

[Rakesh Dubbudu](http://in.linkedin.com/pub/rakesh-reddy-dubbudu/19/409/238), who is working with the [Smart Chicago Collaborative](http://www.smartchicagocollaborative.org/) under the [Professional Fellows Program with the Department of State](http://eca.state.gov/program/professional-fellows-program), will talk about how this legislation is creating ripples in India and the many ways in which citizens are using it to collate data and bring about change in the world's largest democracy.
