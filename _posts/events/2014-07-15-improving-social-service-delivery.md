[Paras Desai](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/paras-desai/1/284/993) and [Daniel Riff](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/daniel-riff/1a/132/579) from the Mayor's Innovation Delivery Team will talk about their work to improve the operations and reach of [6 Community Service Centers](http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/fss/provdrs/serv/svcs/community_servicecenterlocations.html) run by the [Department of Family and Support Services](http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/fss.html). This will be a great opportunity for our open government community to learn about and provide feedback for improving an important City service.

The Mayor’s [Innovation Delivery Team](http://blogs.wttw.com/moreonthestory/2011/07/14/emanuel-announces-innovation-delivery-teams/) is funded by [Bloomberg Philanthropies](http://www.bloomberg.org/program/government-innovation/innovation-delivery-teams/) for the purposes of increasing City government efficiency. Their past projects include [simplifying the licensing process for small businesses](http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/mayor/press_room/press_releases/2012/april_2012/mayor_rahm_emanuelannounces60percentreductioninlicensetypestohel.html) and facilitating the City’s [energy retrofit project](http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/mayor/press_room/press_releases/2012/august_2012/residential_phaseofretrofitchicagolaunched.html).
