[Maryam Judar](http://www.citizenadvocacycenter.org/maryam-judar.html) is the Executive Director and a Community Lawyer at [Citizen Advocacy Center](http://www.citizenadvocacycenter.org/) (CAC), a nonprofit, nonpartisan legal organization with a mission to build democracy by ensuring that the tools and institutions that support public participation in the government public policy decision making process are robust.  

Maryam will talk about how CAC and its clients use data to monitor their local governments for efficiency of resources as well as to root out abuse.
