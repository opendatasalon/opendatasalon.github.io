In August, the [Chicago Public Schools (CPS) website](http://www.cps.edu/) was redesigned from the ground up by their own internal web team. The new site offers a simple, modern, lightweight user interface that works on any device (phone, tablet, laptop or desktop). 

Jay Van Patten and Ted Canji from Chicago Public Schools will talk about their efforts and challenges to build a mobile friendly website with internal resources for the third largest school district in the U.S.
